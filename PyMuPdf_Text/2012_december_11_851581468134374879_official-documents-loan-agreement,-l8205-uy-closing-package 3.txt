Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior

the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction

Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.
