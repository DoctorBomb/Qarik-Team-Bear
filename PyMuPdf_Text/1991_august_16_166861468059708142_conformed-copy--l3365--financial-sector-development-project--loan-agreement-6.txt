      Loan Account, as the case may be, with respect to such amount
      or portion of the Loan. Upon the giving of such notice, such
      amount or portion of the Loan shall be cancelled."
                            SCHEDULE 5
                 Sub-loans: Criteria, Procedures,
                  Principal Terms and Conditions
      Subject to the provisions of Section 3.02 (b) of this
Agreement, and except as the Bank and the Borrower may otherwise
agree, the criteria, procedures and principal terms and conditions
set forth in this Schedule shall apply for the purposes of Section
3.02 (a) of this Agreement.
1.    Each Sub-loan shall be made only to a Private Enterprise which
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower on the
basis of guidelines satisfactory to the Bank, that it is credit-
worthy and its projected internal cash generation or equity
increases shall be sufficient to enable it to carry out the
Investment Project and to contribute at least 30% of the aggregate
cost thereof (excluding the cost of land).
2.    Each Sub-loan shall be made only for an Investment Project
which is: (a) determined to be technically and commercially
feasible, including on the basis, inter alia, of the existence of
markets for its output; (b) designed in accordance with appropriate
safety, health and environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank;
and (c) calculated to have a financial rate of return of at least
12%; all as shall have been determined and calculated to the
satisfaction of the Borrower on the basis of an appraisal, including
an environmental impact assessment, carried out in accordance with
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank.
3.    (a) No expenditures for goods or services required for an
Investment Project shall be eligible for financing out of the
proceeds of the Loan unless:
            (i)    the Sub-loan for such Investment Project shall
                   have been approved by the Bank, and such
                   expenditures shall have been made not earlier
                   than ninety days prior to the date on which the
                   Bank shall have received the application and
                   information required under paragraph 4 (a) of
                   this Schedule in respect of such Sub-loan; or
            (ii)   the Sub-loan for such Investment Project shall
                   have been a free-limit Sub-loan for which the
                   Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan
                   Account, and such expenditures shall have been
                   made not earlier than ninety days prior to the
                   date on which the Bank shall have received the
                   request and information required under paragraph
                   4 (b) of this Schedule in respect of such
                   free-limit Sub-loan. For the purposes of this
                   Agreement, a free-limit Sub-loan shall be a
                   Sub-loan for an Investment Project in an amount
                   to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
                   which shall not exceed the sum of $2,000,000
                   equivalent, when added to any other outstanding
                   amounts financed or proposed to be financed out
                   of the proceeds of the Loan or of any other
                   loan, provided for in any outstanding loan
                   agreement between the Bank and the Borrower or
                   the Guarantor entered into before the date of
                   this Agreement, the proceeds of which have been
                   or are being used for financing goods and
                   services directly and materially related to such
                   Investment Project.
      (b)  The ninety day limitation referred to in sub-paragraphs
(a)(i) and (a)(ii) of this paragraph shall not apply to expenditures
to be financed under Sub-loans in respect of which the applications
and information required under paragraph 4 (a) of this Schedule, or
the requests and information required under paragraph 4 (b) of this
Schedule, as the case may be, are received by the Bank not later
than September 30, 1991.
4.    (a)   When presenting a Sub-loan (other than a free-limit
Sub-loan) to the Bank for approval, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank an application, in form satisfactory to the Bank, together
with (i) a description of the Private Enterprise and an appraisal of
the Investment Project, including a description of the expenditures
proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan; (ii) the
proposed terms and conditions of the Sub-loan, including the
schedule of amortization of the Sub-loan; and (iii) such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
      (b)   Each request by the Borrower for authorization to make
withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect of a free-limit
Sub-loan shall contain: (i) a summary description of the Private
Enterprise and the Investment Project, including a description of
the expenditures proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Sub-loan, including
the schedule of amortization therefor.
      (c)   Applications and requests made pursuant to the provi-
sions of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be
presented to the Bank on or before December 31, 1993.
5.    The proceeds of the Loan which may be withdrawn under a Sub-
loan shall not exceed 90% of the expenditures for items to be
financed under such Sub-loan.
6.    Each Sub-loan shall: (a) have a maturity of not more than 15
years, including a grace period of not more than 5 years; and (b) be
made on other terms, including those relating to interest and other
charges, which are in accordance with the Borrower’s applicable
policies and procedures pursuant to the Credit Policy Guidelines;
provided, however, that the interest rate to be charged on the
principal amount thereof withdrawn and outstanding from time to
time, shall be equal at least to the greater of: (i) the rate of
interest applicable from time to time to the Loan pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.05 of this Agreement; and (ii) any
additional charge required to be paid on the Sub-loan pursuant to
the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage Scheme.
7.    Each Sub-loan shall be made on further terms whereby the
Borrower shall obtain, by written contract with the Private
Enterprise or by other appropriate legal means, rights adequate to
protect the interests of the Bank and the Borrower, including:
      (a)   that each Private Enterprise shall undertake to: (i)
carry out and operate the Investment Project with due diligence and
efficiency and in accordance with (A) sound technical, financial and
managerial standards, and (B) appropriate safety, health and
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank, maintain adequate
records, and provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities and
other resources required for the purpose; (ii) procure the goods and
services to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan at a
reasonable price, account being taken also of other relevant factors
such as time of delivery and efficiency and reliability of the goods
and availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts therefor,
and, in the case of services, of their quality and the competence of
the parties rendering them (provided that the Private Enterprise
may, with the prior approval of the Bank, carry out works under
force account in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the
Bank), and utilize such goods and services exclusively in the
carrying out of the Investment Project; (iii) enable the Bank and
the Borrower to inspect such goods and the sites, works, plants and
construction included in the Investment Project, the operation
thereof, and any relevant records and documents; (iv) take out and
maintain with responsible insurers such insurance, against such
risks and in such amounts, as shall be consistent with sound
business practice, including, without limitation, such insurance to
cover hazards incident to the acquisition, transportation and
delivery of goods financed out of the proceeds of the Loan to the
place of use or installation, any indemnity thereunder to be made
payable in a currency freely usable by the Private Enterprise to
replace or repair such goods; and (v) prepare and furnish to the
Borrower, for forwarding to the Bank, if so requested by the Bank,
all such information as the Bank or the Borrower shall reasonably
request relating to the foregoing and to the administration,
operations and financial condition of the Private Enterprise and to
the benefits to be derived from the Investment Project; and
      (b)   provisions to ensure the right of the Borrower to
suspend or terminate the right of the Private Enterprise to the use
of the proceeds of the Loan upon failure by such Private Enterprise
to perform its obligations under its contract providing for the Sub-
loan.
