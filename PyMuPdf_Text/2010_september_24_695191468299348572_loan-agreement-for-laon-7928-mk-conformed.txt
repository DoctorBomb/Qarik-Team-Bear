� Bidding shall not be restricted to pre-registered firms.  
 
� Where registration is required, bidders: (1) shall be allowed a reasonable

registration for reasons unrelated to their capability and resources to 
successfully perform the contract, which shall be verified through post-
qualification. 
 
� Foreign bidders not from the territory of the Borrower shall not be precluded 
from bidding. If a registration process is required, a foreign bidder declared 
the lowest evaluated bidder shall be given a reasonable opportunity to 
register. 
 
(c) 
Advertising, time for submission of bids 
 
� Invitations to bid shall be advertised in at least one widely circulated national 
daily newspaper. Invitations could be also advertised on the web sites of the

than thirty (30) days from the time of the invitation to bid or the date of 
availability of bidding documents, whichever is later.   
 
13 
(d) 
Pre-qualification 
 
� When pre-qualification shall be required for large or complex works, 
invitations to pre-qualify for bidding shall be advertised in at least one (1) 
widely circulated national daily newspaper. Invitations could be also 
published on the web sites of the Public Procurement Bureau and respective 
ministry.  
 
� Time allowed for the preparation and submission of bids shall not be less 
than thirty (30) days from the time of the invitation to bid or the date of 
availability of bidding documents, whichever is later.   
 
� Minimum experience, and technical and financial requirements, shall be 
explicitly stated in the pre-qualification documents. 
 
(e) 
Participation of Publicly-owned enterprises 
 
Publicly-owned enterprises shall be eligible to participate in bidding only if they 
can establish that they are legally and financially autonomous, operate under commercial 
law and are not a dependent agency of the contracting authority. Furthermore, they will 
be subject to the same bid and performance security requirements as other bidders.  
 
(f) 
Bidding Documents 
Procuring entities shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents 
acceptable to the Bank for procurement of goods and works. 
 
(g) 
Bid Opening, Bid Evaluation and Contract Award 
 
� Bids shall be submitted in a single envelope containing the bidder’s 
qualification information, technical and price bids, which shall be opened 
simultaneously at the public bid opening. 
 
� No bids shall be rejected at the bid opening except for late bids and bids shall 
not be evaluated as part of bid opening process. 
 
� The economic, financial and technical capacity of the bidders cannot be 
guaranteed by another entity, except joint venture and observing those 
criteria set up in the bidding documents.

criteria declared in the bidding documents and evaluation criteria other than 
price shall be quantified in monetary terms.

place.  
 
(h) 
Rejection of all bids 
All bids shall not be rejected and a new procurement process starts without the 
Bank’s prior concurrence.  
 
(i) 
Price Adjustment 
 
Civil works contracts of long duration (more than 18 months) shall contain an 
appropriate price adjustment clause.  
 
(j) 
Securities 
 
� Bid security and performance security should follow the generally accepted 
practice used in the local market.  
 
� Alternative methods such as bid securing declaration may be acceptable, in 
which case the Borrower may require bidders to sign a declaration accepting that 
if they withdraw or modify their bids during the period of validity or they are 
awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract or to submit a performance 
security before the deadline defined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be 
suspended for bidding in any contract with the implementing unit. 
 
� No advance payment shall be made to contractors without a suitable advance 
payment security. These securities shall be included in the bidding documents in 
a text and format acceptable to the Bank.  
 
(k) 
Right to inspect and audit 
 
Each contract financed from the proceeds of the Loan shall provide that the 
suppliers, contractors and subcontractors shall permit the Bank, at its request, to inspect 
their accounts and records relating to the procurement and performance of the contract 
and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed by the Bank. The 
15 
deliberate and material violation by the supplier, contractor or subcontractor of such 
provision may amount to obstructive practice. 
 
(l) 
Fraud & Corruption 
 
The Bank shall declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a 
stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by the Bank, if it at any time determines 
that the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, 
fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for, or in executing, 
a contract financed by the World Bank Group.

SCHEDULE 3 
 
Amortization Schedule 
 
1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2.  
If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal 
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 
(a) 
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 
(b) 
Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be 
repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in 
amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by 
a fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment 
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment 
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts repayable 
to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies. 
 
3. 
(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts 
17 
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable 
on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment Date 
following the date of withdrawal. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on 
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall 
no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a 
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination 
immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate. 
 
5. 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, 
the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
