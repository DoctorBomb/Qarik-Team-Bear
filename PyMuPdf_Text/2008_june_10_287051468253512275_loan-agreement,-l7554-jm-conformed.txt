SCHEDULE 1 
 
Project Description 
 
The objectives of the Project are to: (a) improve the monitoring of children’s 
development, the screening of household-level risks affecting such development, and early 
intervention systems of the Borrower to promote such development; (b) enhance the quality of 
ECIs; and (c) strengthen early childhood organizations and institutions. 
 
The Project consists of the following parts: 
 
Part 1. Supporting the Implementation of the NSP in the Following Action Areas:
(a) 
Parenting Education and Support. This action area includes: (i) the 
strengthening of the ECC’s parenting sub-committee; (ii) the development and 
implementation of a national early childhood development parenting education 
and support sub-strategy; (iii) a public awareness campaign; (iv) the creation of 
an accreditation system for early childhood parenting education and support 
programs; and (v) a grant facility to support service providers in meeting 
accreditation standards. 
 
(b) 
Preventive Health Care for Children.
This action area includes: (i) the 
reorganization of well-child clinics, including the mainstreaming of well-child 
services at the primary care level, the expansion of the staff, the introduction of 
an accreditation system for health centers offering well-child services, and the 
strengthening of the referral system; (ii) the transformation and scaling up of 
nutritional programs to sustain achievements in reducing under-nutrition and, at 
the same time, address the emerging epidemic of over-nutrition; and (iii) the 
introduction of a child health passport to be used in all health centers. 
 
(c) 
Screening, Diagnosis and Early Intervention. This action area includes: (i) the 
development of a national policy for screening, referral and early intervention; 
(ii) the development of a screening system for household-level risks and its 
application to all households enrolled in the Borrower’s income support program; 
and (iii) the strengthening of the early intervention system through a new cadre 
of health professionals, entitled child development therapists, who will address 
vision, hearing, speech impairments and behavioral development challenges. 
 
(d) 
Safe, Learner-Centered Early Childhood Facilities. This action area includes:  
(i) the strengthening of the inspectorate for the ECIs at the ECC (through the 
provision of Grants for the ECC); and (ii) the strengthening of the support system 
for ECIs, including:  (A) the recruitment of development officers to technically 
support ECIs (through the provision of Grants for the ECC); (B) the training of 
ECI caregivers in safety standards; and (C) the implementation of ECIs 
development plans to meet service standards (through the provision of Grants for 
Community Schools). 
 
-6- 
 
(e) 
Trained Early Childhood Practitioners.
This action area includes the 
implementation of a comprehensive early childhood development human 
resource strategy which entails: (i) the reform of training curricula; (ii) the 
increase in the cadre of trained practitioners; (iii) the upgrading of skills of early 
childhood development practitioners; and (iv) the development of continuing

expenditures.  This will be supported through the provision of Grants for the 
ECC. 
 
(g) 
Evidence-Based Decision Making. This action area includes the strengthening 
of the national early childhood development management and information 
system and the national early childhood development statistics.  These systems 
will include the application of an internationally developed, locally adapted 
instrument to monitor the early child status and enable the ECC to report for the 
first time on the performance of the early childhood development system, 
including the human resources situation and the child development status at age 
four.  This will be supported through the provision of Grants to the ECC.

(b) 
Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date. 
 
3. 
(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any
