The Bank may permit the Borrower to electronically deliver applications (with supporting documents) 
through the Bank’s web-based portal (https://clientconnection.worldbank.org) “Client Connection”. This 
option may be effected if the officials designated in writing by the Borrower who are authorized to sign and 
deliver Applications have registered as users of “Client Connection”. The designated officials may deliver 
Applications electronically by completing the Form 2380, which is accessible through “Client Connection”. 
By signing the Authorized Signatory Letter, the Borrower confirms that it is authorizing such persons 
to accept Secure Identification Credentials (SIDC) and to deliver the Applications and supporting 
documents to the Bank by electronic means. The Borrower may continue to exercise the option of 
preparing and delivering Applications in paper form. The Bank reserves the right and may, in its sole 
discretion, temporarily or permanently disallow the electronic delivery of Applications by the Borrower. 
By designating officials to use SIDC and by choosing to deliver the Applications electronically, the 
Borrower confirms through the authorized signatory letter its agreement to: (a) abide by the Terms and 
Conditions of Use of Secure Identification Credentials in connection with Use of Electronic Means to 
Process Applications and Supporting Documentation, available in the Bank's public website at 
https://worldbank.org and “Client Connection”; and (b) to cause such official to abide by those terms and 
conditions.

accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09 of the General Conditions.

provisions of Section 5.09 (b) of the General Conditions. Each audit of the Financial Statements shall cover
