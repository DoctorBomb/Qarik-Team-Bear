Amortization Schedule 
 
1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and 
the percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal 
Payment Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the 
Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be 
determined by the Bank by multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the 
first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal 
Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency 
Conversion applies.

2.  
If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 
(a) 
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been 
withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower 
shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in 
accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 
(b) 
Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment 
Date shall be repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after 
the date of such withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by 
multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in 
20 
 
the table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal 
Payment Date (“Original Installment Share”) and the denominator 
of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment Shares 
for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such 
amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any 
amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a 
Currency Conversion applies. 
3. 
(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior 
to any Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of 
calculating the principal amounts payable on any Principal 
Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on the 
second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal 
and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date 
commencing with the second Principal Payment Date following 
the date of withdrawal. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this 
paragraph, if at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system 
under which invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal 
Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no 
longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such 
billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, 
upon a Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
to an Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that 
is repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion 
Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its 
currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  
 
5. 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan 
Currency, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount 
denominated in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization 
schedule for each such amount.
