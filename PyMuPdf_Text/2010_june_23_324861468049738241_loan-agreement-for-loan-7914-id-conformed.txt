meeting the requirements of sub-paragraph (d) – (k) of this paragraph 5. 
The PIU shall use such report as the sole basis to request a 
Reimbursement. 
(d)

Pilot Local Governments for each Fiscal Year of Project implementation 
in accordance with the schedule set out in the DAK Implementing 
Regulations, and shall notify the Bank of this amount by no later than 
March 31 in such Fiscal Year, commencing with March 31, 2011 
(Annual DAK Allocation).  MOF shall make payments of DAK funds 
(DAK Transfers) from the Borrower’s budget to each Pilot Local 
Government in accordance with the DAK Regulations in each Fiscal 
Year of Project implementation.   
 
(e) 
Advance Payments against Outputs.  The Borrower may request 
withdrawal of the proceeds of the Loan as an Advance Payment against 
Outputs in each Fiscal Year of Project Implementation, beginning with 
Outputs produced in Fiscal Year 2011.  Each Advance Payment shall be 
subject to the procedures and conditions set out below, except as may be 
otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Bank. 
 
(i) 
The amount of the Advance Payment in any Fiscal Year shall not 
exceed the sum of the Rupiah values of the first of the DAK 
Transfers made by MOF to each Pilot Local Government by 
March 31 in such Fiscal Year as such transfers are verified by 
BPKP, provided however that in no event shall the Advance 
Payment exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Annual DAK 
Allocation for that Fiscal Year.   
14 
(ii) 
The Advance Payment in any given Fiscal Year may be made 
prior to the verification of Outputs; provided, however that it is 
subject to set-off, as set out in sub-paragraph (g) of this 
paragraph, following the receipt by the Bank of the Verification 
Report for Outputs for that Fiscal Year to ensure that proceeds of 
the Loan are not disbursed in excess of the Value of Total 
Reimbursement for all Pilot Local Governments for that Fiscal 
Year.  
(f) 
Reimbursement of Verified Outputs.  The Borrower may request 
withdrawal of the proceeds of the Loan as a Reimbursement against 
Outputs in each Fiscal Year of Project implementation, beginning with 
Outputs produced in Fiscal Year 2011.  Each Reimbursement shall be 
subject to the procedures and conditions set out below, except as may be 
otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Bank. 
 
(i) 
BPKP shall verify that each Pilot Local Government has entered 
into a Commitment Letter. 
 
(ii) 
BPKP shall verify that the Reference Unit Costs were provided 
by February 15 in the subject Fiscal Year. 
 
(iii) 
BPKP shall list all Outputs reported by each Pilot Local 
Government by December 31 of the subject Fiscal Year. 
 
(iv) 
BPKP shall calculate the Value of Potential Reimbursement 
for each Pilot Local Government by multiplying the volume of 
Outputs produced by Sub-projects undertaken by Pilot Local 
Government by their Reference Unit Costs. 
 
(v) 
BPKP shall verify a Sample of the Sub-projects in each Pilot 
Local Government in accordance with the VO Terms of 
Reference to determine compliance with the Eligibility Criteria.  
Based on the Outputs in the Sample for each Pilot Local 
Government that meet the Eligibility Criteria, BPKP shall 
calculate the Qualifying Percentage for that Pilot Local 
Government for that Fiscal Year. 
 
(vi) 
BPKP shall calculate the Value of Qualifying Reimbursement 
for each Pilot Local Government for that Fiscal Year by 
multiplying the Qualifying Percentage by the Value of Potential 
Reimbursement.  
 
15 
(vii) 
BPKP shall calculate the Value of Total Reimbursement  that 
may be made by the Bank to the Borrower for that Fiscal Year 
which shall be the sum of the Value of Qualifying 
Reimbursement for all Pilot Local Governments.   
 
(viii) 
BPKP shall calculate the Value of Final Reimbursement that 
may be made by the Bank to the Borrower for that Fiscal Year, 
by subtracting the Advance Payment made in that Fiscal Year 
from the Value of Total Reimbursement. 
 
(ix) 
BPKP shall calculate the LG Reimbursement for each Pilot 
Local Government by multiplying the Value of Qualifying  
Reimbursement for that Pilot Local Government for that Fiscal 
Year by ten percent (10%); it being understood that this 
percentage may, by prior written agreement between the 
Borrower and the Bank, be revised for the purposes of 
calculating the LG Reimbursement.   Upon receipt by the 
Borrower of Reimbursement from the Bank in any Fiscal Year, 
the MOF shall transfer to each Pilot Local Government its 
respective LG Reimbursement. 
 
(x) 
Notwithstanding 
the 
foregoing, 
the 
Value 
of 
Total 
Reimbursement made by the Bank to the Borrower in any Fiscal 
Year shall in no event exceed the Annual DAK Allocation made 
by the Borrower for such Fiscal Year plus 10% (attributable to a 
portion of the LG Contribution). 
 
(g) 
Set-Off.  In the event that the amount of the Advance Payment in any 
Fiscal Year exceeded the amount eligible for reimbursement by the Bank 
(the Value of Total Reimbursement) at the end of the Fiscal Year as set 
out in the Verification Report for that Fiscal Year, then the amount of the 
Advance Payment will be reduced in the subsequent Fiscal Year by the 
amount of overpayment in that Fiscal Year (Advance Payment minus 
Value of Total Reimbursement).  The Bank may, by notice to the 
Borrower, reduce the amount of the Advance Payment, or decline to 
provide any Advance Payment, for any subsequent year of Project 
implementation in the event that this clause was invoked in any Fiscal 
Year. 
 
(h) 
Review of Verification Reports.  Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this paragraph 5, the Bank retains the right to review any 
Verification Report and, based on such review, to not disburse, or to 
disburse a lesser amount of the proceeds of the Loan for, any particular 
requested Advance Payment or Reimbursement. 
16 
(i) 
Without limiting the provisions of Article VII of the General Conditions, 
if the Bank shall have determined at any time that any Outputs did not 
comply with the Technical Guidelines or the Supplemental Guidelines 
(Environmental and Social Safeguards) or that a Pilot Local Government 
has failed to deliver all the Outputs of a Sub-project, the Bank may at 
that time: (A) in any year of Project implementation except the last year, 
offset future Advance Payments and/or Reimbursements by the amount 
equal to the amount of Loan proceeds disbursed to finance Outputs not 
delivered by such Pilot Local Government; or (B) obtain a refund to the 
Bank from the Borrower of an amount equal to the amount of Loan 
proceeds disbursed to finance Outputs not delivered by such Pilot Local

currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the 
exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency 
payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the 
Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion 
Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  
 
5.
