Currency Conversion in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 of this 
Agreement ("Loan"). 
2.02. The Borrower may withdraw the proceeds of the Loan in support of the Program 
in accordance with Section II of Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

extension of the Closing Date shall be at the rate of one quarter of one percent 
(0.25%) of the amount of the Loan available for withdrawal upon such extension. 
If the Borrower elects to capitalize the fee from the Loan, the Bank shall, on
