referred to in this Loan Agreement, the Loan in the amount of two hundred and eighty-five million Euros
(EUR 285,000,000) for the purpose of making a Loan Contribution to the Trust Fund. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Loan Contribution does not constitute a loan to the Trust Fund. The amount of the Loan,
including the principal repayments, shall be denominated in Euros.
2.2 
The Loan shall consist of one Drawdown. Upon satisfaction of the condition precedent to the
Drawdown specified in Section 4.2 and Annex II (Conditions Precedent) to this Loan Agreement, the
Lender and the Fund shall agree in writing in advance on the Drawdown Date, which shall, unless
otherwise agreed between the Lender and the Fund, fall on a Business Day between 1 February 2017
and 30 November 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that as of the date of
this Loan Agreement, the Bank's role as the interim trustee of the Trust Fund terminates on 30 April
2018 under paragraph 8.4 of the GCF Trust Fund Agreement. The Trustee will not request any

which case the provisions of paragraph 8.6 of the GCF Trust Fund Agreement, paragraph 5.4 of the
Standard Provisions and Section 8.6 of this Loan Agreement shall apply.
2.3 
Upon agreement by the Lender and the Fund in Section 2.2, the Secretariat shall, by not less
than twenty-five (25) Business Days prior to the Drawdown Date, send a Written Instruction, specifying
the Drawdown Date to the Trustee. By sending such Written Instruction to the Trustee, the Fund
irrevocably and unconditionally authorizes the Trustee, and the Trustee shall, subject to Section 2.2,
within ten (10) Business Days from its receipt of such instruction, request the Drawdown of the full
amount of the Loan as set out in Section 2.1 by delivering to the Lender a Drawdown Request. If the
Drawdown Request is not received by the Lender as specified in this Section 2.3, the Lender shall
promptly notify the Fund and the Trustee in writing thereof. If, subsequent to such notice, the Drawdown
Request shall not have been received by the Lender at least twenty-five (25) Business Days prior to 31
December 2020, unless agreed otherwise by the Lender and the Fund, the Loan shall be deemed
cancelled as of 31 December 2020.
2.4 
Upon receipt of the Drawdown Request, the Lender shall, on the Drawdown Date, deposit the
amount in Euros into the account designated by the Trustee in the Drawdown Request. When making
such deposit, the Lender shall instruct its bank to include in its payment details information (remittance

and neither in its individual or personal capacity nor as borrower, guarantor or surety. The Trustee shall
be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this Loan Agreement and the
GCF Trust Fund Agreement, and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Fund
or the Lender. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any determination made by the Fund or the
Secretariat under this Loan Agreement, and may rely in good faith on any instruction provided by the
Fund or the Secretariat under this Loan Agreement without further inquiry or investigation on its part,
and shall have no liability for relying in good faith on any such instruction or otherwise for any actions
taken, or omitted to be taken, in good faith. Absent any gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the Trustee, the Trustee's liability under this Loan Agreement shall in any event be limited to the
extent of the resources made available in the Trust Fund pursuant to the GCF Trust Fund Agreement
and this Loan Agreement.
ARTICLE 3 -
TERM AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS

No interest shall accrue or be payable on the Loan.

ARTICLE 4 - CUSHION

Contribution in the amount of fifty seven million Euros (EUR 57,000,000) to the Trust Fund to serve as
France's Cushion, in accordance with the Cushion Contribution Agreement.

(Conditions Precedent).
4.3 
The Fund shall be responsible for ensuring that France's Cushion is used in accordance with the
terms of this Loan Agreement, the Cushion Contribution Agreement and the Applicable Policies.
France's Cushion shall only be used to make repayments of the Outstanding Loan Balance due by the
Fund to the Lender under this Loan Agreement, and not to any other lenders, as set out in Section 5.2
below.
-4-
ARTICLE 5 - LIMITED RECOURSE; PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS
5.1 
The Lender agrees that any repayment obligations of the Fund hereunder shall be limited to the
available Individual Lender's Loan Resources and France's Cushion held in the Trust Fund, and the
Lender shall not have any recourse against any other assets of the Fund or the Trust Fund. The Secretariat
shall, in accordance with the terms of the Standard Provisions, the Applicable Policies, including
International Financial Reporting Standards, and this Loan Agreement, determine the amount of the
Individual Lender's Loan Resources and France's Cushion available in the Trust Fund for the purpose
of making any repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance under Sections 3.2, 3.3 and/or 5.2. For the
purpose of this Loan Agreement, the Individual Lender's Loan Resources shall be determined, in
relation to each Principal Repayment Date, by firstly, deducting from the Lenders' Loan Resources
available in the Trust Fund the total amount of resources to be applied for the reimbursement of France's
Cushion in accordance with Section 5.2(ii) and for the reimbursement of other lenders' respective
Cushions in a similar manner as Section 5.2(ii) at that Principal Repayment Date, as applicable, and
secondly, calculating the pro rata share of the remaining Lenders' Loan Resources available in the Trust
Fund based on the amount of the payment payable under this Loan Agreement to the Lender at that
Principal Repayment Date, relative to the total amounts of payments payable under all Loan
Agreements/Arrangements at that Principal Repayment Date.
5.2 
(i) 
If two (2) months prior to any Principal Repayment Date, the Secretariat determines
that the Individual Lender's Loan Resources available in the Trust Fund are less than the amount due
and payable under this Loan Agreement, the payment on such Principal Repayment Date shall be made
only to the extent of such Individual Lender's Loan Resources available, and:
(A) 
If the Secretariat determines that any part or all of the insufficient Individual
Lender's Loan Resources are due to financial losses from non-performing loans
extended by the Fund under paragraph 3.3(d) of the Standard Provisions as
determined by the Secretariat ("Non-Performing Loans"), the Secretariat shall
(a) use any available France's Cushion to pay the amount representing the
difference between the Individual Lender's Loan Resources available in the
Trust Fund and the scheduled Principal Repayment Amount (the "Unpaid
Amount"), and (b) in the event of insufficient France's Cushion, write off any
or all of such portion of the Unpaid Amount.
(B) 
If the Secretariat determines, in respect to any Principal Repayment Date other
than a last scheduled Principal Repayment Date, that any part or all of the
insufficient Individual Lender's Loan Resources are due to any reasons other
than financial losses from Non-Performing Loans, the Secretariat shall (a) use
any available France's Cushion to pay the Unpaid Amount and (b) in the event
of insufficient France's Cushion, carry forward any and all portion of the
Unpaid Amount remaining unpaid after (a) above, and add such amount to the
scheduled Principal Repayment Amount due and payable at the following
Principal Repayment Date and the Outstanding Loan Balance shall be adjusted
by the Secretariat accordingly. The Secretariat shall also promptly notify the
Lender and the Trustee of the revised schedule for the repayment of the
Outstanding Loan Balance to reflect such carrying forward of the Unpaid
Amount.
-5-
(C) 
If the Secretariat determines, in respect of a last scheduled Principal Repayment
Date, that the insufficient Individual Lender's Loan Resources are due to any
reasons other than financial losses from Non-Performing Loans, and:
(x) 
the Secretariat determines that all Individual Lender's Loan Reflows
(excluding those amounts of financial losses from the Non-Performing
Loans, against which any portion of the Unpaid Amount has been paid
through the use of France's Cushion or written off under Section
5.2(i)(A)) have been collected by the Fund in accordance with
Applicable Policies approved by the Board, then any shortfall of the
repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance shall be paid from the then
available France's Cushion on the last scheduled Principal Repayment
Date, and to the extent there is insufficient available France's Cushion,
any shortfall of the repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance shall
be written off by the Secretariat on the last scheduled Principal
Repayment Date; or
(y) 
the Secretariat determines that any Individual Lender's Loan Reflows
(excluding those amounts of financial losses from the Non-Performing
Loans, against which any portion of the Unpaid Amount has been paid
through the use of France's Cushion or written off under Section
5.2(i)(A)) have not been collected by the Fund in accordance with
Applicable Policies approved by the Board, then, notwithstanding
Section 3.2, the schedule for the remaining repayment of the
Outstanding Loan Balance shall be revised by the Secretariat, taking
into account the amounts and timing of when such Individual Lender's
Loan Reflows are expected to be collected by the Fund as determined
by the Secretariat. In such case, the Secretariat shall promptly notify
the Lender and the Trustee of the revised schedule for the repayment
of the Outstanding Loan Balance on the new Principal Repayment
Dates. For greater clarity, the Secretariat may revise the schedule for
the remaining repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance in
accordance with this Section 5.2(i)(C)(y) 
until the Secretariat
determines that all Individual Lender's Loan Reflows (excluding those
amounts of financial losses from the Non-Performing Loans, against
which any portion of the Unpaid Amount has been paid through the use
of France's Cushion or written off under Section 5.2(i)(A)) will have
been collected by the Fund in accordance with Applicable Policies
approved by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretariat
may only revise the payment schedule to the extent that the last
Principal Repayment Date under any new schedule shall not extend
beyond five (5) years from the original last Principal Repayment Date
specified in the notice from the Fund to the Lender and the Trustee
pursuant to Section 2.4, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Lender, the Fund and the Trustee. The provisions of Section 5.2 shall
apply to the payments to be made under any new payment schedule. If
the payment schedule may not be revised further under this Section
5.2(i)(C)(y), and if the Secretariat determines two (2) months prior to
the last Principal Repayment Date thereunder that there are insufficient
Individual Lender's Loan Resources, any shortfall of the repayment of
the Outstanding Loan Balance shall be paid from the then available
-6-
France's Cushion on the last Principal Repayment Date, and to the
extent there is insufficient available France's Cushion, any shortfall of
the repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance shall be written off by
the Secretariat on the last Principal Repayment Date.
(ii) 
In the event the Secretariat determines that any amount of the Individual Lender's Loan
Reflows, against which any amount of France's Cushion has been used under Sections 5.2(i)(B) and
(i)(C)(y) for cases where the insufficient Individual Lender's Loan Resources are due to any reasons
other than financial losses from Non-Performing Loans, have been collected, such amount of Individual
Lender's Loan Reflows as determined by the Secretariat shall be applied for reimbursing France's
Cushion at the immediately following Principal Repayment Date. The reimbursement of France's
Cushion under this Section 5.2(ii) may be made up to the date falling five (5) years from the original
last Principal Repayment Date specified in the notice from the Fund to the Lender and the Trustee
pursuant to Section 2.4, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Lender, the Fund and the Trustee. If
any date of reimbursement falls after all payments to the Lender under this Loan Agreement have been
made in full, such amount of reimbursement shall be added to the amount of the Grant Contribution in
accordance with paragraph 3.4 of the Standard Provisions.
(iii) 
Within twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Principal Repayment Date in relation to
which any repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance shall be written off, the Secretariat shall notify
the Lender and the Trustee in writing of the amount and the date of the repayment of the Outstanding
Loan Balance to be written off. The Lender and the Fund acknowledge that any amount so written off
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.2 shall no longer be considered due and payable by
the Fund to the Lender under this Loan Agreement, following such notification by the Secretariat.
5.3 
Following determination by the Secretariat of the available resources under Sections 5.1 and 5.2
above, and no later than ten (10) Business Days, but no earlier than thirty (30) Business Days, prior to
any Principal Repayment Date, the Secretariat shall deliver to the Trustee a Written Instruction
instructing the amount of repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance to be made under this Loan
Agreement on such Principal Repayment Date. 
With the Secretariat's delivery of such Written
Instruction to the Trustee, the Fund irrevocably and unconditionally authorizes the Trustee, and the
Trustee agrees, to process such repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance in accordance with, and to
the extent of, the Written Instruction and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.
5.4 
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, the Trustee shall transfer to the Lender, on each
Principal Repayment Date and out of the Trust Fund resources held by it, the amount so instructed by
the Secretariat in the Written Instruction, as payments under Sections 3.2, 3.3 and/or 5.2, as applicable.
5.5 
Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, any payment under this Loan Agreement shall be
made in Euros.
5.6 
Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day that is a TARGET
Day shall be made on the next Business Day that is a TARGET Day.
5.7 
All payments by the Trustee under this Loan Agreement shall be paid to the bank account of the
Lender designated by the Lender to the Trustee in writing on the date hereof, or to such other account
designated by the Lender to the Trustee in writing no less than thirty (30) Business Days prior to a
relevant Principal Repayment Date.

5.8 
All payments required to be made by the Lender or the Trustee under this Loan Agreement shall
be calculated without reference to any set-off and shall be made free and clear of and without any
deduction for or on account of any set-off.
5.9 
The Fund shall verify, keep record of and track the uses of the Lenders' Loan Resources, the
Lenders' Loan Reflows, the Individual Lender's Loan Resources, the Individual Lender's Loan Reflows
and the France's Cushion under this Loan Agreement and the Cushion Contribution Agreement. The
Fund shall report to the Lender on the uses of such types of resources on a semi-annual basis, unless
otherwise agreed between the Fund and the Lender. The Trustee shall neither verify, keep record of,
track, nor report on, any uses of such types of resources, and shall not establish any sub-account in the
Trust Fund for this purpose. The Trustee shall process any repayment of the Outstanding Loan Balance
out of the Trust Fund resources at the Written Instruction from the Secretariat in accordance with
Sections 5.3 and 5.4, without regard to types of resources tracked by the Fund, whether Lenders' Loan
Resources, Lenders' Loan Reflows, Individual Lender's Loan Resources, Individual Lender's Loan
Reflows, France's Cushion or otherwise and without tracking the Contributions made or reflows
received during the IRM Period or any subsequent replenishment period.
