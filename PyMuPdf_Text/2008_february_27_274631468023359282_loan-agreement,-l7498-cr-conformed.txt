Special Procurement Provisions
1. 
Procurement of Goods and Works Without limitation upon other provisions of this 
Section or the Procurement Guidelines, the following additional provisions shall apply to 
all goods, non-consultants services and works procured for the Project under contracts 
awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (“NCB Contracts”): 
 
(a) 
The Borrower shall submit (or cause to be submitted) all forms and models of 
requests for quotations and bidding documents that the Borrower proposes to use 
for the procurement of goods and works under NCB Contracts (the “Standard 
Bidding Documents”) to the Bank for its approval before the Borrower issues its 
first invitation for bids for any of the NCB Contracts for the Project.  Except as 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not amend, revise or 
otherwise modify or change the Standard Bidding Documents that have been 
approved by the Bank in accordance with the foregoing sentence (the “Approved 
Bidding Documents”). 
 
(b) 
Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder: (a) who meets the appropriate technical and financial 
standards or capabilities; and (b) whose bid has been determined to be the lowest 
evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the 
specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the Approved 
Bidding Documents.  If the bid evaluation will consider any factor other than the 
amount or amounts of each bid, the Approved Bidding Documents will precisely 
stipulate and describe each such factor, including, inter alia, the manner in which 
such factor will be quantified and given a relative weight for purposes of 
determining the lowest evaluated bid.  The award of goods and works contracts 
shall be based exclusively on price and, whenever appropriate, shall also take 
into account factors similar to those referred to in paragraph 2.52 of the 
Procurement Guidelines; provided, however, that the bid evaluation shall always 
be based on factors that can be quantified objectively, and the procedure for such 
quantification shall be disclosed in the invitation to bid. For purposes of bid 
evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor 
shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, as such 
bid may be corrected by the Borrower for arithmetic errors. 
 
-17- 
 
(c) 
Foreign bidders shall be allowed to participate and shall not, as a condition for

embassy or consulate of the Borrower, the Borrower’s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, or any other governmental authority or representative of 
the Borrower, as a pre-condition to participating in the bidding process. 
 
(d) 
No reference value shall be required for publication in the bidding documents 
and call for bids. 
 
(e) 
Any standards and technical specifications (quoted in the bidding documents) 
which are at least substantially equivalent to the standards and technical 
specifications of the Borrower shall be acceptable.

a contract for goods or works.

1. 
The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the

Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the 
Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the Installment Share for each Principal Payment Date[, such repayable amount to be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule,

Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 
 
(a) 
To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 
 
(b) 
Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion 
applies. 
3. 
(a) 
Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and 
-23- 
 
outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date following the date of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-
paragraph shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of 
such billing system.  
 
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved 
Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction 
relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  
 
5. 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the 
provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
