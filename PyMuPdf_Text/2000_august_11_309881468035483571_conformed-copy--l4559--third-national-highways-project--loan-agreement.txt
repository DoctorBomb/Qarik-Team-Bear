deposited into the Special Account pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Annex; provided, however, that

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan, minus the total amount 
of all outstanding special commitments entered into by 
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General 
Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, 
withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
