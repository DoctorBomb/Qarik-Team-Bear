each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts

Installment Share") and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining

Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on
or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-

billing system.
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs I and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of
denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that
reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under
the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so
determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate
component of the Screen Rate.
