9.1 On the last day of each Interest Period the Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the Advance
to which such Interest Period relates. |

9.2 The rate of interest applicable to an Advance from time to time during an Interest Period

Quotation Date therefor. |

16. Alternative Interest Rates

10.1 In relation to any Advance and any Interest Period relating thereto:

(i)

(ii)

if (but only if) LIBOR for such Advance would, but for this provision, be determined

at Or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for such Interest Period none of the
Reference Banks was offering to prime banks in the London Interbank Market
deposits in doliars for the proposed duration of such Interest Period; or |

if before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for such Interest
Period, the Agent has been notified by a Bank or each of a group of Banks to whom
in aggregate sixty-seven per cent. or more of the amount of the Loan is (or, if an —
Advance were then made, would be) owed that LIBOR for such Advance (whether
determined in accordance with paragraph (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof) does not
accurately reflect the cost to it of obtaining such deposits.

then, notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9:

(a)

(b)

if paragraph (i) above applies, the duration of that Interest Period shall be one month
or, if less, such that it shall end on the next succeeding Repayment Date; and -

if paragraph (i) or (ii) above applies, the rate of interest applicable to such Advance
from time to time during such Interest Period shall be the rate per annum which is
the sum of the Margin and the rate per annum determined by the Agent to be the
weighted arithmetic average (rounded upwards, if not already such a multiple, to the
nearest whole multiple of one-sixteenth of one per cent.) of the rates notified by each
Bank to the Agent before the last day of such Interest Period to be those which
express aS a percentage rate per annum the cost to each Bank of funding from
whatever sources it may select its portion of such Advance during such Interest
Period (and, in determining such weighted arithmetic average, the Agent shall, in its
calculations, make due allowance for the relative size of each Bank’s participation in
such Advance in relation to each Bank’s respective cost of funding as afcresaid);
Provided Aiways that: |

determination and notification as aforesaid (or such earlier date as :may be
agreed between the Banks, the Agent and the Borrower) the rate of interest
applicable to such Advance for the remaining part of such Interest Period
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9

Period but, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest which has already
accrued in relziion to such Advance pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this sub-paragraph (b) shall only be payable by the Borrower at the end of the
remaining part of such Interest Period together with the other interest due in
relation to such Advance and that Interest Period;

respect of all such Advances shall not exceed six months and, in relation to

_ any remaining part of any Interest Period for any Advance to which the

foregoing provisions of this sub-paragraph (b) cannot be applied by virtue of

applicable to such Advance for the remaining part of such Interest Period
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8 and 9

THE SEVENTH SCHEDULE

Form of Opinion of General Counsel to IBRD

From; IBRD General Legal Counsel
: [address]
To LO Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited

as agent on its own behalf and for and on behalf of the Managers
and the Banks referred to in the Facility Agreement mentioned below

{  ], 1994
Dear Sirs

1. T refer to the loan and guarantee agreement (the "Loan Agreement”) dated [ _ ],
1994 and made between the People’s Republic of China as Borrower, the International Bank for
_ Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") as partial guarantor, BOT International (H.K.) Limited,
Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as
Afrangers, the financial institutions named therein as Lead Managers, the financial institutions named
therein as Managers, the financial institutions named therein as Co-Managers, the financial institutions
named therein as the Banks and Dresdner (South East Asia) Limited as Agent.

2. I have reviewed the proceedings of IBRD to authorise the involvement by IBRD as partial
guarantor on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement and, in connection with such
review, I have examined among other things, the following: |

(a) the Articles of Agreement, By-laws and Rules of Procedure for Meetings of the
Executive Directors of IBRD;

(b) the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Directors of IBRD held on [ ] May,

1994 at which action was taken to record the approval of the Executive Directors on
[ ] May, 1994 of IBRD’s said involvement as partial guarantor:

(c) the approval and agreement of each member of IBRD required under Section 1(d) of
Article IV of said Articles of Agreement for the partial guarantee of IBRD under the
Loan Agreement; | | .

(d) the Resolution, dated [ ] December, 1991, authorising [ ]
of IBRD to sign in the name and on behalf of IBRD any instrument or document in
connection with IBRD’s said involvement as partial guarantor: and |

(e) the Loan Agreement.

.70-

 

ne ee tee Me ce i

 
3. Based upon the foregoing and such legal considerations as I deem relevant, I am of the .
opinion that: | |

(1) IBRD is an international institution duly established and existing under Articles of
Agreement drawn up by the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held
at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July 1944.

(2) IBRD has the power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan
Agreement and to comply with the provisions thereof and the Loan Agreement has
been duly authcrised, executed and delivered by IBRD.

(3) | The Loan Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of IBRD in

! accordance with its terms (insofar as the terms of the Loan Agreement apply to
IBRD), and the obligations of IBRD thereunder rank at least pari passu with all the
direct and contingent liabilities of IBRD.

(4) All consents (including any internal consents of IBRD), approvals, authorisations,
| filings or registrations required by or of IBRD in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Loan Agreement and the performance by IBRD of its obligations
thereunder have been obtained and are in full force and effect and such execution,
delivery and performance does not and will not (i) require any further consent,
approval or authorisation of, or any ratification by, or any filing, registration or
qualification with, any person in each case under present laws and regulations or (ii)
violate any provision of IBRD’s Articles of Agreement or By-Laws or any law, rule
or regulation or of any order, judgment, injunction, decree, resolution, determination
or award of any court or arbitrator or any judicial, administrative or governmental
authority or organisation, in each case presently in effect having applicability to
IBRD.

(5) IBRD has full juridical personality with capacity to make contracts, to acquire and
dispose of property and to sue and be sued.

(6) The obligations of IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee are entitled to the benefits of
Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of IBRD and, with respect to any action
brought by any of the Banks or the Agent in any of the courts specified in Clause 26
of the Loan Agreement in connection with any of IBRD’s obligations under the IBRD |
Guarantee, IBRD has no immunity from amy legal action, suit or proceeding, in, or
Jurisdiction of, any such court or any legal process (whether service or notice, set-off,

_ attachment or seizure in aid of execution of judgment, or execution of judgment) with
respect to itself or any of its property or assets and to the extent any such immur’ty
is ascribed to it IBRD has waived it; provided, however, that the property and assets
of IBRD shall, wheresoever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from all
forms of seizure, attachment or execution before the delivery of final judgment
against IBRD as provided in said Article VII. The appointment of the process agents
of IBRD pursuant to Clause 26.2 of the Loan Agreement is valid and effective.

} — (7) Under IBRD’s Articles of Agreement, the IBRD Guarantee and payments made
| thereunder are not subject to any tax by a member of IBRD (i) which tax

 
(8)

_ discriminates against such IBRD Guarantee and payments made thereunder solely
_ because such IBRD Guarantee was issued by IBRD or (ii) if the sole jurisdictional

basis for the tax is the place or currency in which such IBRD Guarantee was issued ,

or in which obligations thereunder are made payable or paid, or the location of any
Office or place of business maintained by IBRD.

The execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement and the performance by IBRD of
its obligations thereunder will not violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default
under, any provision of any indenture, contract or other undertaking to which IBRD
is a party or by which it or its property is bound or, to the best of my knowledge,
of any law applicable to it. | |
