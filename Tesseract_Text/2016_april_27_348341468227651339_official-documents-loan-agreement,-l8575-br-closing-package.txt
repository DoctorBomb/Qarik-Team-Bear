case more than one year from the date of this Agreement) provided that the Borrower
shall have submitted the relevant EEP Spending Report for the referred period and
such report shall have been found satisfactory by the Bank, in accordance with the
provisions of the Project Operational Manual and the Additional Instructions; and

for payments made under Category (1) unless:

(1) a relevant EEP Spending Report covering the period preceeding to a
respective withdrawal request, shall have been submitted to, and found
satisfactory by, the Bank, in accordance with the provisions of the Project
Operational Manual and the Additional Instructions; and

(i1) all other conditions referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the
Additional Instructions, including comliance with any applicable DLI (for
the respective semester as referred to in Schedule 5 to this Agreement) shall
have been met by the Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank.

Withdrawals under Category (1) shall be made in 9 installments (including the first withdrawal
referred to in Section B.1 (a) above. The subsequent eight withdrawals shall be made in the
months of February and August of each year upon: (a) submission of a respective EEP
Spending Report confirming actual expenditures for the EEPs incurred in the previous six-
month period, or any other period defined in the Additional Instructions; and (b) evidence of

-15-
compliance with the respective DLIs as described below and further detailed in the Additional
Instructions.

If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the quantitative DLIs (DLI #1,
DLI #3 through DLI #5, and DLI #7 through DLI #15) listed in Schedule 5 to this Agreement,
in respect to any Loan withdrawal under Category (1) other than the first Loan withdrawal (as
referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional Instructions), then:

(a) the Bank shall disburse the Loan amount of the corresponding withdrawal attributable
to each DLI, in proportion to the respective degree of execution of each DLI and in
accordance with the Additional Instructions;

(b) the Borrower shall prepare and furnish to the Bank a satisfactory time-bound action
plan specifying the measures to achieve full compliance of such DLI or DLIs in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank; and

(c) as soon as the Bank is satisfied that said action plan has been implemented, the Bank
shall authorize the withdrawal of unwithdrawn Loan amount by which the
corresponding Loan withdrawal had been reduced in the withdrawal period following
the date of implementation of said action plan, all as further detailed in the Additional
Instructions.

If the Bank has not received evidence of full compliance with the qualitative DLIs (DLI #2
and DLI #6) listed in Schedule 5 to this Agreement, with respect to any Loan disbursement
under Category (1) (as referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional
Instructions), then:

(a) the Bank shall withhold the corresponding withdrawal attributable to each DLI not
complied with;

(b) the Borrower shall prepare and furnish to the Bank a satisfactory time-bound action
plan specifying the measures to achieve full compliance of such DLI or DLIs in a

Instructions.

incurred under a respective EEP in respect to any withdrawal request under Category (1) (as
referred to in the Project Operational Manual and in the Additional Instructions), then the
correspondent undisbursed amount due to the lack of Eligible Expenditures shall be carried
forward to the subsequent withdrawals and may be paid only if evidence of enough Eligible
Expenditures are presented under the subsequent withdrawal request.

-16-

 
In the event that the Bank has not approved a full withdrawal by the Borrower of the Loan
proceeds under Category (1) due to partial evidence of compliance with the DLIs, and /or lack
of documentation of Eligible Expenditures, or lack of satisfactory performance by the
Borrower under an action plan referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the Bank may, by
notice to the Borrower, cancel the corresponding amount of the Loan after the last Loan

items improperly procured in violation of Section III to this Schedule; or (b) was not used for
Eligible Expenditures; or (c) in case of the EEPs under Part | of the Project, was not supported
by evidence of actual spending by the Borrower under said Eligible Expenditure Programs
and/or (d) by evidence of satisfaction of other criteria set forth in this Agreement or in the
Project Operational Manual, the Borrower shall promptly refund any such portion to the Bank
as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.

The Closing Date is December 31, 2020. The Bank may grant an extension of the Closing

Date only after the Guarantor’s Ministry of Finance has informed the Bank that it agrees with
such extension.

SCHEDULE 3
Amortization Schedule

The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the percentage of
the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment Date (“Installment
Share”). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal
Payment Date shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance
as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal Payment
Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to
in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

Expressed as a Percentage
On each March 15 and September 15
Beginning March 15, 2020
through March 15, 2035 3.13 %
On September 15, 2035

If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment
Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment
Date shall be determined as follows:

   

       
  

  
 

(a) To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance as of
such date in accordance with paragraph | of this Schedule.

(b) Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on each
Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the table
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment
Share”) and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original Installment
Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such date, such amounts
repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph
4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

(a) Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal amounts
payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as withdrawn and outstanding on
the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal and shall be
repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal
Payment Date following the date of withdrawal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any time
the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued on or after

-18-

 
the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no
longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency
Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an Approved Currency,
the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable on any Principal Payment
Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying
such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either:
(i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable
by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the Conversion; or (ii) if the
Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate
component of the Screen Rate.

If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency, the

provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each Loan
Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
